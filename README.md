## About

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a platform for competitive coding and technical interviews. This repository contains my solutions to HackerRank challenges across different domains like Algorithms, Data Structures, SQL, and more.

Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and provide feedback or improvements!

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized by HackerRank domains and subdomains. Each challenge has its own directory named after the challenge title, and within each directory, you'll find the solution file(s) and any necessary supporting files.
